# What's this then?

It's the fourth homework exercise for a software development course I'm doing. This was the final exercise assigned at the end of the Python module of the coursework. The idea was that we should practice the concepts we'd learned by creating a basic representation of a karaoke bar using class definitions for rooms, songs, and guests.

It doesn't have any UI stuff at all; we hadn't covered any frontend yet. It's just a bunch of classes and unit tests. If you want to run the unit tests to check that they actually pass, run `run_tests.py` from a terminal. There's not much more to it.
